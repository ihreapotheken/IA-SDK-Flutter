# Cart Screen

Provides a complete, self-managed flow for cart, checkout, and payment. The screen is reactive and integrates seamlessly
with other modules: when a product is added to the cart elsewhere in the app, the cart screen automatically reflects
the update.

**Features**
* **Empty cart screen:** When the cart is empty it shows recommended products and products of the month. It allows
  users to add products and prescriptions.
* **Cart screen:** Overview of all products and prescriptions in the cart, including cost section.
* **Checkout screen:** Delivery and payment options, product overview, prescription overview, and the cost section.
* **PayPal payment:** In-app PayPal integration.
* **Thank You screen:** Overview of the order.

The cart screen is part of the `ia_ordering` package.

## Launch
```dart
await IaSdk.instance.ordering.launchCartScreen();
```

## Platform view
The cart screen embedded in a tab bar, `viewId` is `cartScreen`.

```dart
Scaffold(
  body: IndexedStack(
    index: _selectedIndex,
    children: const [
      IaSdkPlatformView(viewId: 'cartScreen', selfSizing: false),
      // Your other tabs.
    ],
  ),
  bottomNavigationBar: NavigationBar(
    selectedIndex: _selectedIndex,
    onDestinationSelected: (index) => setState(() => _selectedIndex = index),
    destinations: const [
      NavigationDestination(icon: Icon(Icons.shopping_cart), label: 'Cart'),
      // Your other tabs.
    ],
  ),
)
```

> [!TIP]
> If your app embeds the cart in a tab bar, you can switch to that tab instead of letting the SDK open a new cart
> screen. See [SDK Interaction](../interaction.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Read [Presentation](../presentation.md) in order to understand how IA SDK screens can be presented in your app.
